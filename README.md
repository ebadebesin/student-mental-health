The objectives of the Analysis is to investigate student mental health and explore factors that contribute to Student have mental health issue.

Through this comprehensive analysis, our objective is to uncover underlying patterns and correlations that can guide the development of targeted interventions and support systems for students. By examining the interplay between age, CGPA, marital status, and depression status, we aim to gain a holistic understanding of the challenges and successes that students encounter throughout their educational journey.

As we delve into this dataset, our aim is to derive actionable insights that not only deepen our comprehension of student dynamics but also establish the foundation for crafting tailored strategies to promote student well-being and academic achievement.

Within the realm of student well-being and academic success, the dataset sourced from Kaggle serves as a comprehensive repository, capturing vital facets of students' lives. This dataset encapsulates crucial variables such as age, Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA), marital status, and delves into the nuanced dimension of depression status. As we embark on this analysis, the dataset acts as a lens through which we unravel the intricate interplay of personal, academic, and mental health factors shaping the student experience.

# Conclusion

- Despite the overall depression rate being approximately 35% among students, a significant discovery emerges: students with a CGPA of 3.25 exhibit a higher prevalence of depression compared to those with CGPAs of 2.75 and 3.75. This intriguing finding prompts further investigation into the factors contributing to the heightened incidence of depression among students with a CGPA of 3.25.

- An intriguing pattern surfaces regarding panic attacks, particularly among second-year students. This observation prompts inquiries into potential stressors or challenges specific to the second year of academic pursuits that may influence the occurrence of panic attacks.

- Contrary to expectations, single students are found to experience instances of both panic attacks and depression compared to their married counterparts. This discovery challenges assumptions about the perceived support systems in marital relationships and underscores the need for a nuanced exploration of the factors influencing mental health across different relationship statuses.

- A concerning revelation is that none of the students who experienced depression sought medical treatment. This highlights a potential gap in mental health support systems, raising questions about the accessibility of mental health resources on campus and the necessity for interventions to encourage seeking professional help among affected students.

## Recommendations

Here are some recommendations based on our analysis and conclusion:

1. **Implement Mental Health Awareness Programs:**
   Develop and implement multifaceted mental health awareness campaigns to destigmatize seeking help for mental health concerns. Foster a campus culture that prioritizes open dialogue about mental health, offering forums, events, and discussions to raise awareness. Ensure students are well-informed about available resources and support services through targeted communication channels and outreach efforts.

2. **Enhance Academic Support for certain GPAs:**
   Develop targeted academic support initiatives tailored to students with specific academic standings, including personalized tutoring, academic coaching, and study strategy workshops. Implement interventions to address underlying factors contributing to academic stress, such as time management skills, test anxiety management, and resilience-building activities.

3. **Tailor Support for specific Year Students:**
   Design specialized support programs catering to the unique challenges faced by different students' years of study or classification. Offer stress management workshops, peer mentoring programs, and transition support services to help students navigate the academic, social, and personal adjustments commonly associated with their year of study.

4. **Provide Comprehensive Mental Health Resources:**
   Ensure the availability and accessibility of a wide range of mental health resources on campus, including counseling services, support groups, crisis hotlines, and online resources. Promote these resources proactively through campus-wide campaigns, orientation programs, and digital platforms to reach students across diverse demographics.

5. **Explore Relationship Status Dynamics:**
   Conduct research to understand the specific stressors and support needs of students in different relationship statuses. Develop targeted interventions and support services tailored to address the unique challenges faced by single students, married students, and those in other relationship statuses. Consider organizing relationship workshops, couples counseling sessions, and support groups to foster healthy relationship dynamics on campus.

6. **Implement Periodic Mental Health Check-ins:**
   Integrate regular mental health check-ins into existing campus programs, such as academic advising sessions, orientation programs, and wellness events. Provide students with opportunities for self-assessment, confidential support, and referrals to mental health professionals as needed. Use feedback from these check-ins to inform the ongoing development and improvement of mental health support services.
